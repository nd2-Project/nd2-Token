# nd2-Token
***A gratitude token for our collaborators.***

The nd2 project wants to reward all contributions with a gratitude token. The projects that are waiting for our technical solution are very keen to boosting community support to finish it as soon as possible. For this reason, some of them have made us a promise that will be able to generate value to these tokens and that they will materialize the day our protocol is running on each of their nodes.

## Funtions

Interested projects will create, in a short time, decentralized applications that will integrate our token ND2 giving it a functionality. Thus, you will understand their business first-hand and at the same time help improve their products. By using them in each of the DApps, you will be able to increase your amount of tokens in your wallet. In addition, they will give you great benefits such as priority access to the first stages of official coin offering, discounts on purchases and even swap for native cryptocoin. These are the promises so far:

## WagerChain Promise

We will create a great solution based on blockchain technology for the gambling industry around the world. It will benefit bettors, governments and allow you to participate at any scale in this profitable business. We will create a mockup of our best products as a DApp hosted on the same blockchain as the ND2 token. You'll can increase your ND2 quantity in 3 different ways:
1. Placing bets and winning in any of our lottery models. (Q2 - 2021)
2. Creating your own lottery so that all ND2 holders can bet safely while you get great returns. (Q3 - 2021)
3. Providing liquidity and backing to the launched lotteries and obtaining profit for it. (Q3 - 2021)

> We will swap your ND2s for our native cryptocurrency during the initial coin offering (ICO) stage. The value of each ND2 will be considered as the equivalent of ~USD$1 at the time of exchange. A maximum of 10 million (1% of the total issued) of native coins will be swaped.

## PreXta Promise

PreXta will handle a native cryptocurrency and some stablecoin. We will provide the best investment alternatives with a new easy, agile, efficient and safe credit system. Then you can be part of this great market that will provide excellent returns to investors and true financial inclusion for everyone. In the meantime, your wallet addresses will be allowed to participate in our sandbox. We do not enable mockup on a mainnet due to high fees.

We only hope for a secure and efficient blockchain that allows fast micropayments at low fees. We wait for FPoS.

> Your ND2 tokens will be accepted as payment value in our ICO. A portion of the issuance is allocated to this swap as a contribution to the development of the technology we need. Your ND2 tokens will be accepted for ~USD$1 each at our ICO stage.

## Disclaimer

Any contribution to the project as a donation is just that "a donation". The nd2 token is a gratitude token. Receiving it is optional, free and voluntary. The nd2 project does not assign or suggest a commercial value. It has not been created to trade it. If you consider selling or buying it, you do so with your own responsibility and acknowledgement. The receiver must understand the basic operation of the BEP20 (ERC20) tokens to ensure good use and custody. The project is not able to recover tokens due to loss of private keys or seed phrase. The nd2 project is not responsible for future values or for the promises fulfillment of our sponsors. The promises fulfillment of our sponsors is also subject to the success of this proposal. Although it is not a commercial token, full registration is requested on our platform to comply with the regulation and to confirm the recipient when the tokens are delivered outside of the distribution contract way. The funds collected are assigned to the different needs of the project without this obliging the nd2 project to give details of expenses to the donors.
